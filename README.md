# Analysing Spotify top 100 playlist with SQL

Analysing top 100 playlist between 2010-2019 in SQL to get a better understanding of the songs/genres. This is by no means a complicated analysis, the queries are very basic and it's simply a "exercise" for me, the author, to practice newly acquired SQL knowledge.


The data is a set of all songs from Spotify's top 100 playlist from 2010-2019 (100 songs from each year, over a 10 year period).
